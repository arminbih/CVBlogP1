                lively child... untill my mother got me my first PC. I fell in love with technology then, but lets not
                kid ourselves it was mostly because of games. But actually my love of technology goes further back when
                I got my first gaming console. It was a knock-off Nintendo Famicom, and called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ending-Man_Terminator" class="content-a">Terminator.</a> It
                almost never worked without problems and had an adapter that could last for a whole two hours before
                frying itself. The Chinese were not known for their quality products then...</p>

            <p>Now that we now the reason for this technological obsession let's continue. After breaking about a
                hundred controllers playing Mario Bros, and countless other popular titles which I can't even remember
                now, in a few years the age of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ending-Man_Terminator"
                    class="content-a">Terminator</a> was over. Couple of my friends including me started getting their
                first PC's. They were mostly IBM's with pentium 3 processors (the lucky ones had pentium 4's) and big
                bulky CRT monitors. My main concern once I got my hands on one, despite all the educational
                possibilities, was how to get some games to run. Most of the PC's then ran Windows 98, and let me tell
                you it was a real challenge getting that first game to run. But oh what a game it was.

            <p>I don't remember games having mature rating then. But Doom would definitely have an 18+ rating. Not that

                In this chapter lets begin with experiences. For a better part of my life I did not really know what I
                want to do. With life in general. But I guess that's normal, and you could probably say that for most of
                the adolescents. Especially adolescents of that time, our time... After all we were the<a
                    class="content-a" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=90%27s%20kid"> 90s kids.</a>
                As I am now reflecting on this period there comes to mind a lot of mixed memories and feelings. The joys
                of yuth are plenty but so are the sorrows. <a class="content-a"
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8GW1GaoIc"> Into this house we're born in to this world
                    we're thrown. </a>
                <figure class="image-container">
                    <div class="image__wrapper" style="max-width: 540px;">
                        <div class="image__padding" style="padding-bottom: 90%; padding-top: 10px;">
                            <img class="image-container__image" src="images/undraw_road_sign_mfpo.svg" alt="">

            </p>
            <p>
                Another factor that contributed to that confusion is war. The country had gone through a rough period of
                internal conflict and it got ugly fast. Now you can imagine (or perhaps you can't) that post war period
                and all the merits it brought. Let's just say that kids were not the only ones who were confused. I've
                always had alot of <strong>passion in doing anything that I love</strong> ever since I was a kid.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was probably the most stubborn child of all the kids. When I got a hold of something, an idea, I
                just would not let go. I would go to the apsolute extremes with it. I can't stress enough that this
                is not a good thing, no matter what anyone says. Having passion for <em>something</em> is great it
                is what pushes you forward, but if you are not able to control it and slow down, you will burn out
                fast.
